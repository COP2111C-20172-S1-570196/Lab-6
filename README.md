Currency Layer
I'am using the currencylayer API. It returns currency exchange information in JSON.
In this example you have two options.
1. Select a currency from the first drop down menu and get the exchange of one United States Dollar vs that currency.
2. In the form Select an amount and a currency and hit submit. It will display the amount you can exchange your United States dollars for.
